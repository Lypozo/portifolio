        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>1999: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>2001: The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <div class="sub-2">
            <h2>Principle</h2>
            <p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <h3>Common templates</h3>
                <p>User stories may follow one of several formats or templates.</p>
                
                <p>The most common is the Connextra template, stated below. Mike Cohn suggested the "so that" clause is optional although still often helpful.</p>
                
                <p class="field">As a &lt;role&gt; I can &lt;capability&gt;, so that &lt;receive benefit&gt;&lt;/receive&gt;</p>
                
                <p>Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering software, and proposed this alternative:</p>
                
                <p class="field">In order to &lt;receive benefit&gt; as a &lt;role&gt;, I can &lt;goal/desire&gt;</p>
            </ul>
